## How to Run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `netlify dev`

To run this app locally, you'll need to install the `netlify-cli`
using `npm install -g netlify-cli`. The React app and the serverless
functions will be served at
[http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888).

You'll also need to add a `.env` file in the root directory and
include `FAUNA_SECRET_KEY=<your secret key>`
